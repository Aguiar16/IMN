# Interactive matching network for multi-turn response selection
This repository contains the source code for the paper [Interactive Matching Network for Multi-Turn Response Selection in Retrieval-Based Chatbots](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.01824.pdf) by Gu et al. <br>

Our proposed Interactive Matching Network (IMN) has achieved new state-of-the-art performance on four large-scale datasets that are publicly available for research on multi-turn conversation.
